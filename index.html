        <h2 class="headings">About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Reginald Desrosiers, a passionate Software Engineer based in Maryland. With a strong background in Sales & Marketing, I love to create innovative and visually appealing projects that leave a lasting impact. My journey in Software Engineering has allowed me to work with diverse clients and hone my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. When I'm not busy crafting digital experiences, you can find me reading, writing, and watching YouTube videos about manga and comedy. Feel free to explore my work and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate on something exciting!</p>
